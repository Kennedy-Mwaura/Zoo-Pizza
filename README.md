## Brief Description of the project

This is a  web application to fulfill the following:

1. Determine the prices for each pizza size.
2. Each pizza topping should have a set value depending on the size of the pizza.
3. Determine the cost for the crust
4. The total cost of a pizza should constitute, the crust, topping(s) and size of the pizza.
5. On checkout, the application displays the ordersâ€™ summary together with the total amount charged. For example, if the customer has made more than one pizza order, on checkout the application displays a summary of all the orders he/she has made and the total amount to pay for all his/her orders.
